# digital_ethics_database
Database of researchers on digital ethics and various layers of analysis of said database.

This project was funded for its first three months by the Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker Zentrum at the University of Tübingen (Germany). 

The main objectives of this work are the following:
a) creation of an open database of researchers in digital ethics;
b) Generation of a map locating those researchers
c)Model the primary trends in digital ethics research with Machine Learning Topic Modeling tools.

By „digital ethics,“ I denote all the research pertaining to the ethical and political consequences of digital technology and the process known as digitalization. This is meant to embrace several subfields of academic research, such as „algorithmic ethics,“ „AI ethics,“ „computer ethics“, “ethics of technology“ when applied to digital technology, and „ethics of digital transformation.“ It is not meant to be limited to any discipline but excludes purely technical computer science work –which can be sometimes named „algorithmic fairness“ or „AI fairness“- and legal work exclusively focused on positive law. The inclusion of those two subfields would have expanded the scope of the project, already highly ambitious, beyond any reachable horizon, and would have exposed our audience to fragmentation.

	The programs were conceived and tested in two environments. For the topic modeling scripts, they were run on the Workspace of the Datacamp website for CPU access. All other programs were run in a Spider environment v. 5.2.2 part of the Anaconda 3 distribution with Python 3.9.13 and OS Windows 11 Pro 22H2.

	For more details on the design of this project and the interpretation of results, see the series of publication on the Digital Ethics Database Project published on the website digitalization-ethics.com as of April 25 2023. Please note that the publication of the project on digitalization-ethics.com, the personal website of this project's author, is only temporary. This is a gracious gesture towards the Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker Zentrum, which experienced difficulties with the dedicated website after major issues with the University virtual servers. We will keep a link to the final publication website (www.aissh.uni-tuebingen.de) once those issues are resolved.

	Considering the huge scale of data collection and the numerous potential add-ons, this is an on-going project as of 2023. The current program of publication as of April 2023 is the following:
i) Preprocessing programs & topic modeling programs and outcomes (Frequency analysis, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Bertopic) for France and Germany.
ii) Table of individual researchers for France and Germany after collection of written, individual consent ( a couple weeks later).
iii) Publication of map.
iv) Publication of webscraping programs.

We will publish the code alongside those series of publications. As a consequence, the first code publication correspond to a naive, default-parameter implementation of the methods, and the state of pre-processing at the moment of publication. 

The individual-level datasets will also be published in Creative Commons licence, but only for the researchers who will have given their explicit written consent.
